### What is hREA?

hREA is a system for tracking economic activities like:
- **Resource Management**: Inventory tracking and resource allocation
- **Supply Chain Coordination**: Managing product flows from producer to consumer
- **Service Delivery**: Tracking service commitments and delivery
- **Community Sharing**: Organizing shared resources and collaborative projects
- **Project Management**: Coordinating work and resource allocation

### Key Concepts

#### Economic Agents
- **People**: Individuals participating in economic activities
- **Organizations**: Companies, non-profits, cooperatives

## Understanding Economic Concepts

### REA Accounting Model

hREA is based on the **REA (Resources, Events, Agents)** accounting model:

- **Resources**: Economic goods and services
- **Events**: Economic activities affecting resources
- **Agents**: People and organizations involved in economic activities

### Double-Entry Economic Accounting

Every economic activity has balanced entries:
- When resources move from Agent A to Agent B
- Both sides of the transaction are recorded
- Complete audit trail of all economic flows

### ValueFlows Standards

hREA implements the **ValueFlows** specification for:
- **Standardized Vocabulary**: Consistent terminology
- **Interoperability**: Works with other ValueFlows-compatible systems
- **Semantic Clarity**: Unambiguous economic relationships
