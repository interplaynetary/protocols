You can check your current public IP address using ifconfig.me.</p><p>Open your cloud firewall for HTTP and HTTPS One of the most common sources of misconfiguration is not opening firewall ports correctly. Please be sure to double check this step.</p><p>In your cloud provider&#39;s console, the following ports should be open to inbound access from the public internet.</p><p>80/tcp (Used only for TLS certification verification) 443/tcp (Used for all application requests) Note: there is no need to set up TLS or redirect requests from port 80 to 443 because the Caddy web server, included in the Docker compose file, will handle this for you.</p><p>Configure DNS for your domain From your DNS provider&#39;s control panel, set up a domain with records pointing to your server.</p><p>Name Type Value TTL example.com A 12.34.56.78 600 *.example.com A 12.34.56.78 600 Note:</p><p>Replace example.com with your domain name. Replace 12.34.56.78 with your server&#39;s IP address. Some providers may use the @ symbol to represent the root of your domain. The wildcard record is required when allowing users to create new accounts on your PDS. The TTL can be anything but 600 (10 minutes) is reasonable Check that DNS is working as expected Use a service like DNS Checker to verify that you can resolve domain names.</p><p>Examples to check (record type A):</p><p>example.com random.example.com test123.example.com These should all return your server&#39;s public IP.</p><p>Installer on Ubuntu 20.04/22.04 and Debian 11/12 On your server via ssh, download the installer script using wget:</p><p>wget <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bluesky-social/pds/main/installer.sh" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bluesky-social/pds/main/installer.sh</a></p><p>Copy Copied! or download it using curl:</p><p>curl <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bluesky-social/pds/main/installer.sh" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bluesky-social/pds/main/installer.sh</a> &gt;installer.sh</p><p>Copy Copied!

Verifying that your PDS is online and accessible The most common problems with getting PDS content consumed in the live network are when folks substitute the provided Caddy configuration for nginx, apache, or similar reverse proxies. Getting TLS certificates, WebSockets, and virtual server names all correct can be tricky. We are not currently providing tech support for other configurations.</p><p>You can check if your server is online and healthy by requesting the healthcheck endpoint.</p><p>You can visit <a href="https://example.com/xrpc/_health" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://example.com/xrpc/_health</a> in your browser. You should see a JSON response with a version, like:</p>',23),s("p",{"version:0.2.2-beta.2":""},null,-1),t('<p>Copy Copied! You&#39;ll also need to check that WebSockets are working, for the rest of the network to pick up content from your PDS. You can test by installing a tool like wsdump and running a command like:</p><p>wsdump &quot;wss://example.com/xrpc/com.atproto.sync.subscribeRepos?cursor=0&quot;</p><p>Copy Copied! Note that there will be no events output on the WebSocket until they are created in the PDS, so the above command may continue to run with no output if things are configured successfully.</p><p>Creating an account using pdsadmin Using ssh on your server, use pdsadmin to create an account if you haven&#39;t already.</p><p>sudo pdsadmin account create</p><p>Copy Copied! Creating an account using an invite code Using ssh on your server, use pdsadmin to create an invite code.</p><p>sudo pdsadmin create-invite-code</p><p>Copy Copied!

If you aren&#39;t seeing your first post/profile, wait 30s and try to make another post.</p><p>Updating your PDS It is recommended that you keep your PDS up to date with new versions, otherwise things may break. You can use the pdsadmin tool to update your PDS.</p><p>sudo pdsadmin update</p><p>Copy Copied! Getting help Visit the GitHub for issues and discussions.
