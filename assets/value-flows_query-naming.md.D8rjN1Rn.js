Many are not. This section is to provide guidance on naming for those that are not explicitly specified, as well as other basic and more involved queries, to facilitate standard api naming.</p><p>This document is NOT meant to imply that all of these named methods should be implemented in any particular application api. Most implementations will want to use only a fraction of these.</p><p>Status: Many of these queries are not tested, and there will certainly be other useful queries.
